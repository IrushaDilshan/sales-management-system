# How to Issue Stock to a Shop

This workflow explains how a Rep or Admin can issue (add) stock to a specific shop or salesman's inventory.

## Method 1: Via Web Dashboard (Admin/Manager)

1. Navigate to the **Inventory** page (`/stock`).
2. Click the **+ Add Stock Reference** button.
3. In the modal:
   - **Product Portfolio**: Select the item you want to issue.
   - **Deployment Center**: Select the Shop/Outlet you are issuing stock TO.
   - **Quantum (Quantity)**: Enter the amount.
   - **Batch/Dates**: Fill in optional tracking info.
   - **Audit Remarks**: Add notes like "Initial issue" or "Restock".
4. Click **Initialize Stock Entry**.
   - The stock will immediately appear in that Shop's inventory.

## Method 2: Via Mobile App (Rep-to-Shop Transfer)

If the Rep has their own "Van" or "Warehouse" inventory on the app:

1. Open the **Salesman Dashboard** on the mobile app.
2. Tap on **Transfer Stock**.
3. **Select Destination**: Choose the Shop you are giving stock to.
4. **Select Items**: Use the +/- buttons to specify how much to transfer from your current inventory.
5. Tap **Transfer Items**.
   - Stock is deducted from your inventory and added to the target Shop's inventory instantly.

## Verification

After issuing stock:
1. The Salesman should open their **My Inventory** page on the mobile app.
2. The page will auto-refresh and show the new items/quantities.
